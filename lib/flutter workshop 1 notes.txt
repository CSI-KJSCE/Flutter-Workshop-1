************* KEEP THE CODE BESIDES YOU FOR REFERENCE ******************
DAY 1:
=> Intro To Flutter - What is Flutter? & why flutter?
-- Flutter is Google's UI toolkit to create mobile , web and desktop applications. It is a multi-platform, open source and free
   framework provided by google to make applications development easier. flutter incorporates dart programming language to build some 
   super interactive applications. but , in this workshop we are not going to use much dart. 
   now that we have an overview of flutter, let me explain you how does it work. so, flutter is completely made up of widgets.
   we can implement those widgets in a way which will create a good looking UI. to add interactivity , we incorporate dart language.So, 
   i hope that you can understand what i am saying. One big advantage of flutter is that it can build an app on a single codebase
   So, if i am an app dev then i might have to create seperate code bases for ios and android but in flutter we can build app for 
   android and ios on a single codebase which saves a lot of time and effort.


=> keep the project open with the demo code and make that run just to show them

=> delete all the code and start with importing material.dart
-- this import consists of different classes that we use in flutter which implement material design in flutter

=> void main and then give a brief about stateless and stateful widgets and then write stles to get the template of stateless ready
-- then write runapp and then include myapp in it.

=> Dart OOP
-- since dart is an OOP language everything in flutter is classes and methods and objects. considering this reference , explain the
   'class MyApp extends statelesswidget'. here give a one liner explaination about extends that it just helps us to access the 
   statelesswidget

=> explain materialApp and include scaffold(after involving scaffold, remove debug banner)
-- Scaffold is a class in flutter which provides many widgets like Drawer,
   SnackBar, BottomNavigationBar, FloatingActionButton, AppBar etc. ...

=> explain Mainaxissize.max in brief
-- it basically gives the parent widget max size to include all the children widgets such as column

=> explain parent child relationship using the ppt

=> come to align widget and align it accordingly and include container and include margin and width accordingly seeing from the code

=> include boxdecoration and explain what it does and include color gradient as shown in our code and border radius
-- The BoxDecoration class provides a variety of ways to draw a box.The box has a border, a body, and may cast a boxShadow.
   open the definition and show

=> take stack as a child of container and explain stack with the help of ppt

=> then make a container in stack and teach them how to import image asset

=> make the shape of the image circular and then align it to center left with some margins (use BoxDecoration)

=> create column and then create two containers with text by this we will end the first container

=> tell them to try the second container and till then you complete the second container fast. after they ahve tried it just
   explain what you did to them and this marks the end of first day of the workshop.


DAY 2:
=> day 2 begins with the custom function for the titledecoration.
   declare it above run app and it is of the type boxdecoration
